# Udacity_DataAnalyst

These are projects done for the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree

*Project 1* - Global Weather Trends
In this project I compare the temperature trend in Oslo with the global temperature trend throughout the years 1750-2013. I used MS Excel for plotting and editing text.

*Project 2* - Economic and Population Indicators for Number of Cars Owned by Citizens
In this project I study why in some countries in the world people own more 4-wheel vehicles than in others. I used Python data science libraries in the project. 

*Project 3* - Analyze_A_B Test Analysis
Is the converting rate of a new page any better than for old page? The statement has been tested by Random Sampling, Z- test and also Logistic Regression. My goal was to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision. 
*Project 4* - Data Wrangling Project
Data Wrangling is about the gathering, accessing, cleaning and analyzing the data. We have analyzed tweets on the WeRateDogs twitter account from 2015-11-15 up to 2017-08-01. With the given and downloaded data, I analyzed favorite and retweet counts based on the ratings. I assigned to these ratings also the most frequent breed, and I determined the most common breeds and also the tweet with the highest favorite and retweet counts based on the whole dataset. Dataset contains one plot, 2 tables and additional report files (pdf).

*Project 5* - Communicate your data findings
In this project I chose the data about loans (Nov 2005- Mar 2014) in the Prosper company. Borrowers are private persons. I was answering the main questions: 

What factors affect a loan’s outcome status? 
What affects the borrower’s APR or interest rate?
Are there differences between loans depending on how large the original loan amount was?

I did exploratory and explanatory visualisations and converted slides into a slidedeck. In this project I used advanced (multivariable) plotting in seaborn.
