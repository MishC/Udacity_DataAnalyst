# Udacity_DataAnalyst

These are projects done for the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree

Project 1 - Global Weather Trends
In this project I compare the temperature trend in Oslo with the global temperature trend throughout the years 1750-2013.

Project 2 - Economic and Population Indicators for Number of Cars Owned by Citizens
In this project I study why in some countries in the world people own more 4-wheel vehicles than in others.

Project 3 - Analyze_A_B Test Analysis
For this project, I have worked to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. My goal was to work through this to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
